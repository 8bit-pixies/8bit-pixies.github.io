Maybe its time to "restart" my blog. I've actually been blogging for quite a while previously - though it was more adhoc. 

This blog will place a heightened focus more on engineering and technology - the _doing_ of things. 

**How did I build this blog?**

I decided to use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to build this static blog. It provides a way to combine code outputs in a blog format. Perhaps we want to post research results or outcomes! This is a suitable way to do that.
